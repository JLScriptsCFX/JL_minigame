Hello! :)

Thank you for downloading our script. We have high hopes that you will utilize it in your project.
Without further ado, here’s an explanation of how it works.

1. To use the UI, you need the following export:

exports['JL_minigame']:OpenGame('open', time, "Title", steps)

The export includes:

. The time allowed to complete the game
. The title
. The number of steps the player must complete


Here’s an example of the export:

exports['JL_minigame']:OpenGame('open', 20, "Open Bank", 2)

This means the player must complete 2 steps in 20 seconds to trigger the bank window.
The script is free, and we do not allow it to be sold for any currency!
Future updates may involve some visual changes.
Thank you for your trust, and we wish you good luck! :)
